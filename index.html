		<h2>About HarmonyHub</h2>
		<p>Keightly is a software developer with a passion for music. Whether it's tackling a difficult coding problem or finishing a school assignment, music is a constant companion for Keightly. With a love for discovering new artists and songs, Keightly has always been curious about how music can connect people with similar interests.</p>
		<p>It was this curiosity that led Keightly to develop an application that could provide better music recommendations and connect users with similar music tastes. With a focus on personalization, Keightly's application uses a variety of data points to suggest playlists and artists based on a user's listening history and preferences.</p>
		<p>As a music lover and developer, Keightly is dedicated to creating an application that helps users discover new music and connect with others who share their passion.</p>
